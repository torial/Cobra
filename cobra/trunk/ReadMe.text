The term "Cobra" is used herein to refer to "The Cobra Programming Language"

Cobra is a high-performance, rapid-development programming language.
It combines features from Python, C#, Objective-C, Eiffel and other languages
in order to boost developer productivity.


Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows, Mac or Linux.

Microsoft .NET 2.0 - Cobra can be used with or without the SDK installed.
 -or-
Novell Mono 1.2

    .NET:   http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates
    Mono:   http://www.mono-project.com/


Installation and Execution
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No special installation program is required. Put Cobra wherever you like in
your file system.

To run:
    > path\to\cobra MyProgram.cobra
The source code extension is not required:
    > path\to\cobra MyProgram
To run again:
    > MyProgram.exe
To just compile:
    > path\to\cobra -compile MyProgram
If cobra is in your path:
    > cobra MyProgram
To learn about all the options:
    > cobra -help

Note that for Novell Mono you would say "mono cobra.exe" as in:
    $ mono path\to\cobra.exe ...
However, that is easy to fix with a simple, one-line shell script put in
your path:
    mono path\to\cobra.exe $*
and then you can say:
    cobra ...
